# capture_frames_from_camera

The program captures a single frame from a webcam/camera. You can capture multiple frames by just removing "break" of the if statement.
It will capture many frames once the limit is removed.
If you want to capture frames for a pre-recorded video, you need to change the (0) value to your video file directory.
Ejoy!
